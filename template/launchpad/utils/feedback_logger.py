"""
This module contains functions to log data to S3.
There are two main methods:

1. insert_feedback_form(appdata_to_capture: dict = None)
    - This method renders the streamlit component for feedback form.
    - It takes a dictionary and combine the data in the feedback form.
    - It then sends the combined dictionary to S3 as a log

2. dictionary_to_log_on_s3(feedback_dictionary: dict = None) 
    - This method takes a dictionary and sends it to S3 as a log.
    - It can be used to send default logs, all inputs and the response, every time the "submit" button is clicked.
    - Suggest to use a different folder (than the one for feedback form) to collect the default logs.

Requirements:
- Create a S3 bucket and a IAM role with access to the bucket.
- Create a .env file with the following variables based on the IAM role:
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    - REGION_NAME
- Install the dependencies in requirements.txt file
- Change the BUCKET_NAME variable to the name of your bucket.
